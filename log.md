# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 
* worked out python fundamentals.
* started learning django; observed and coded the documentation tutorial of creating polls app.
* watched some videos on Django, read blogs and looked for some resources.

**Thoughts**:
Honestly, I didn't imagine that django would be that alienated to me. The way I heard that Django is far more easier for beginners as compared to flask, I found it hard to understand. But I prepared my mind thinking that it's just because of my first time I am studying about some popular framework. I thought to be consistent to work out my way too slowly.

**Resources used**:
* [official Django Tutorial ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/)
* [Sentdex Tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/django-web-development-python-tutorial/)
* Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes
