**Thoughts:** Honestly, I didn't imagine that django would be that alienated to me. The way I heard that Django is far more easier for beginners as compared to flask, I found it hard to understand. But I prepared my mind thinking that it's just because of my first time I am studying about some popular framework. I thought to be consistent to work out my way too slowly.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
